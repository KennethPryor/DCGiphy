          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <hr>
          <p> My name is Kenneth Lloyd Pryor.I was born in Deland, Flordia on 01/31/1999 during the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIII" target="_blank">Superbowl</a>.I grew up with computers
            and was always very good with them or any form of technology.As a kid I was playing computer games before I knew 
            the alphabet.I would take apart the computers and just mess with CMD thinking I was king of the world.I started 
            working at 16, my first job was detail at a Hyundai Dealership.I washed cars and did little things
            like take out the trash and stuff.About a year later, I moved into the parts department and was a counter-person
            for about another year.I took a web-development course in high school and learned basic HTML and CSS.I graduated
            Baldwin High School in 2017 and moved to Atlanta that fall.<br><br> I started work as a service advisor at Thornton
            Rd Hyundai and still currently employed there.I enrolled into a Coding Bootcamp @ Georgia Tech in 2018. I'm very outgoing
            and naturally a leader.My greatest weakness is I over think alot of things.I love the Ocean and always wanted to be a 
            Marine Biologist and study Sharks.I also have a fasination with Mythology, Ancient Greek mostly and Poseidon as he's the 
            God of the Seas.<br>
